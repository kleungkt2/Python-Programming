Student A uses two dictionaries to record two types of ratings for options s/he considers: a dictionary that records the rating of how good a gift would be for student B (on a scale of 1-5), and a dictionary that records the rating of how much student B wants the gift (on a scale of 1-5). The rating of a gift that is not in either of the dictionaries is considered to be 0.\n",
